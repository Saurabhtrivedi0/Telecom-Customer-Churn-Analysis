## Executive Summary

We looked at **7,000+ customers** and found that about **26% churn**. Most of the data was clean, and after fixing a few TotalCharges issues, the patterns became clear.

The biggest churn risks are **senior citizens, new customers, and people on month-to-month contracts**. For example, seniors churn at around **42%**, almost double non-seniors. Customers in their first 6 months churn the most around **55%** and month-to-month users make up almost **90%** of all churn.

Service type also matters. **Fiber-optic customers** churn at **~41%**, much higher than DSL. And customers without Online Security or Tech Support churn almost 3x more than those who have these add-ons.

Billing behavior plays a role too. Customers paying via **electronic check** churn at about **45%**, which is far higher than any other payment method. Plus, churned customers pay more on average—about $74/month vs. $61 for retained customers.

So overall, the people most likely to leave are:

seniors,

new customers,

month-to-month users,

fiber-optic users,

and electronic check payers.

To reduce churn, the best moves are: **push longer contracts, support new customers early, address fiber-optic pain points, promote security/support add-ons, and shift customers away from electronic checks.**
